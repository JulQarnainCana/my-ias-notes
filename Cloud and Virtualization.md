### **Hypervisors (Two Types)**

- **Type 1: Native (Bare-metal):**  
  Operates directly on the system’s hardware, managing virtual machines without the need for a host operating system.

- **Type 2: Hosted:**  
  Runs as a software application within a host operating system, providing virtualization on top of the existing OS.

### **Content Delivery Networks (CDN)**

- **CDN:**  
  A globally distributed network of servers that deliver web content and services to users.

- **Function:**  
  Automatically selects the server closest to the user’s location to reduce latency and improve loading or download speed.

### **Cloud Deployment Models**

| **Model**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public Cloud**    | The most common and cost-efficient model. Cloud resources are provided over the Internet by third-party service providers (e.g., **Google Drive**, **AWS**).                                    |
| **Private Cloud**   | Operates within a private infrastructure where the organization manages and secures all resources internally (e.g., **AWS GovCloud (US)**).                                                     |
| **Hybrid Cloud**    | Combines private and public cloud environments. Organizations may develop some resources internally while using public cloud services for others. Strict data management policies are required. |
| **Community Cloud** | Shared infrastructure among multiple organizations with similar objectives.  Connecting to another organization’s network can also mean inheriting its **security risks**.                      |
| **Single Tenancy**  | Each customer (tenant) has a dedicated set of resources or infrastructure.                                                                                                                      |
| **Multitenancy**    | Multiple customers share the same cloud infrastructure while keeping data isolated from one another.                                                                                            |

### **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**

- A **CASB** acts as a security checkpoint between users and cloud applications, ensuring secure and compliant connections.  
- Provides **visibility and control** over how cloud services are accessed and used.

**CASB Key Benefits:**
- Enables **Single Sign-On (SSO)**  
- Enforces **access controls** and **authorization policies**  
- Detects and removes **malware** and **unauthorized devices**  
- Monitors **user behavior** and **resource activity**  
- Minimizes the risk of **data breaches** and **unauthorized access**

> [!tip]  
> CASBs bridge the gap between users and cloud providers, ensuring data security, compliance, and visibility across all cloud applications.
