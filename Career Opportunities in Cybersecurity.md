## Vulnerability Scanning

**Vulnerability Scanning** is a systematic process used to identify weaknesses or security flaws within an information system. It is typically performed using automated tools that scan for known vulnerability signatures and potential threats. However, the results generated by these tools should always be manually verified by a security tester to ensure accuracy and to eliminate any false positives. This process helps organizations strengthen their security posture by proactively identifying and addressing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
